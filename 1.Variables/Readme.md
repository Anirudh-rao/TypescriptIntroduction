# Intro To variables

Similar to JS we Can use let to assign a Variable

``` let  id:number  = 5```

By assigning it to a number we are assigning Id to Number and no other Data type.

Useful commmands in Typescript:

1. ```tsc index ```  - Converts ```index.ts``` into  ```index.js``` .
2. ``` tsc --watch --index ``` -  Watches For Changes in 
```index.ts```.

3. ``` tsc --init ``` - will Generate a ```tsconfig``` files that project configuration file.
